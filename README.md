# Awsome recipe cookbook
### Demo DevOps repository for use in teachings in It-architechture, cloud and agil udvikling at EK ITA Spring 2026

This is the "Awsome recipe cookbook" repository. It is not meant for production as it contains several security vulnerabilities and problematic parts on purpose. 

## How to get started

Each branch is a tutorial in a different topic based on the same Flask application as in the `main` branch. 

One way to follow along is by:

1. Forking the repository to your own account.

2. Cloning the repository to your local machine.

3. Checking out the branch you are interested in (e.g. `git checkout <branch_name>`).

4. Following the instructions in the README of the branch.

5. You can now push changes to your own repository. 

## Pull requests

If you have any suggestions or improvements to the tutorials, feel free to open a pull request.
